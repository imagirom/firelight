Introduction
============

Firelight is a package for the visualization of :mod:`pytorch` tensors as images.
It uses a flexible way of handling tensor shapes, which allows visualization of data
of arbitrary dimensionality (See :mod:`firelight.utils.dim_utils` for details).

This documentation is work in progress, as is the package itself.

For now, have a look at the `Examples <auto_examples/index.html>`_,
check out the currently available `visualizers <list_of_visualizers.html>`_
or read the `docstrings <firelight.html>`_.
